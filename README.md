**Business Problem**

Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small 
business jets to medium-sized machines. We have been providing 
high-quality air transportation services to our clients for several years, and 
our primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey 
for our passengers. However, we are currently facing challenges due to 
several factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight 
taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market 
resulting in increased labor costs. As a result, the company's profitability is 
under pressure, and they are seeking ways to address this issue. To tackle 
this challenge, they are looking to conduct an analysis of their database to 
find ways to increase their occupancy rate, which can help boost the 
average profit earned per seat.    


**Objective**

The main goal of this Data Analysis using sql would be identify opportunities to increase occupancy rate on low performing flight. 
which can be ultimately lead  to increases profitability for the Airline.

**1. Increase occupancy rate:**
By increasing the occupancy rate, we can
boost the average profit earned per seat and mitigate the impact of the challenges we're facing.

**2.Improve pricing strategy:**
We need to develop a pricing strategy that
takes into account the changing market conditions and customer preferences to attract and retain customers.
**3.Enhance customer experience:**

We need to focus on providing a seamless and convenient experience for our customers, from booking to arrival, to differentiate ourselves in a highly competitive industry 
and increase customer loyalty.

The end goal of this task would be to identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate on low-performing flights, which can ultimately 
lead to increased profitability for the airline.

**Conclusion**

To summarize, analyzing revenue data such as total revenue per year, 
average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft is 
critical for airlines seeking to maximize profitability. Airlines can find 
areas for improvement and modify their pricing and route plans as a 
result of assessing these indicators. A greater occupancy rate is one 
important feature that can enhance profitability since it allows airlines 
to maximize revenue while minimizing costs associated with vacant 
seats. The airline should revise the price for each aircraft as the lower 
price and high price is also the factor that people are not buying 
tickets from those aircrafts. They should decide the reasonable price 
according to the condition and facility of the aircraft and it should not 
be very cheap or high. 
Furthermore, boosting occupancy rates should not come at the price 
of consumer happiness or safety. Airlines must strike a balance 
between the necessity for profit and the significance of delivering 
high-quality service and upholding safety regulations. Airlines may 
achieve long-term success in a highly competitive business by 
adopting a data-driven strategy to revenue analysis and optimisation.
